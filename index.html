          <p>
            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 - 27 July 2015)
            was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president
            of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram,
            Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent
            the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator,
            mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)
            and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
            involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile
            development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of
            India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and
            launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,
            technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
            1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
            Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the
            support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
            then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
            "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education,
            writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient
            of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's
            highest civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the Indian
            Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
            apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands,
            including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony
            held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full
            state honours.
