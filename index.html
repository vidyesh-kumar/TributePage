      <div id="intro">
        <p>
          Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 - 27 July 2015)
          was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president
          of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram,
          Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent
          the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator,
          mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)
          and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately
          involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile
          development efforts. He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of
          India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and
          launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational,
          technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
          1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
          Kalam was elected as the 11th president of India in 2002 with the
          support of both the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the
          then-opposition Indian National Congress. Widely referred to as the
          "People's President", he returned to his civilian life of education,
          writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient
          of several prestigious awards, including the Bharat Ratna, India's
          highest civilian honour. While delivering a lecture at the Indian
          Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an
          apparent cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands,
          including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony
          held in his hometown of Rameswaram, where he was buried with full
          state honours.

        More About Our Misile Man
      </h3>
      <div>
        <details>
          <summary id="life" onclick="MClick('life')">Early Life And Education</summary>
          <p>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931 to a Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage
            centre of
            Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father
            Jainulabdeen
            Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque; his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.His father owned
            a ferry
            that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.Kalam was the
            youngest
            of four brothers and one sister in his family. His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and
            landowners, with
            numerous properties and large tracts of land. Even though his ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders,
            the family
            had lost most of its fortunes by the 1920s and was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. Marakayar
            are a Muslim
            ethnic found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descendance from Arab traders and local women.
            Their
            business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as
            well as
            ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers in order to add
            to the
            family's meager income. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the
            businesses failed
            and the family fortune and properties were lost over time, apart from the ancestral home.</p>
          <p>In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had
            a strong desire to learn. He spent hours on his studies, especially mathematics. After completing his
            education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend Saint Joseph's
            College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics
            in 1954. He moved to Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology. While
            Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was dissatisfied with his lack of progress and
            threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met
            the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to
            meet a difficult deadline". He narrowly missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed
            ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.</p>

          <summary id="Presidency" onclick="MClick('Presidency')">Presidency</summary>
          <p>During his term as president, he was affectionately known as the People's President,saying that signing the
            Office of Profit Bill was the toughest decision he had taken during his tenure.Kalam was criticised for his
            inaction in deciding the fate of 20 out of the 21 mercy petitions submitted to him during his tenure.
            Article 72 of the Constitution of India empowers the President of India to grant pardons, and suspend or
            commute the death sentence of convicts on death row. Kalam acted on only one mercy plea in his five-year
            tenure as president, rejecting the plea of rapist Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was later hanged.Perhaps the
            most notable plea was from Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri terrorist who was convicted of conspiracy in the December
            2001 attack on the Indian Parliament and was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court of India in 2004.While
            the sentence was scheduled to be carried out on 20 October 2006, the pending action on his mercy plea
            resulted in him remaining on death row. He also took the controversial decision to impose President's Rule
            in Bihar in 2005.In September 2003, in an interactive session in PGI Chandigarh, Kalam supported the need of
            Uniform Civil
            Code in India, keeping in view the population of the country.</p>

          <p>Nearing the expiry of the term of the 12th President Pratibha Patil on 24 July 2012, media reports in April
            claimed that Kalam was likely to be nominated for his second term. After the reports, social networking
            sites witnessed a number of people supporting his candidature.The BJP potentially backed his nomination,
            saying that the party would lend their support if the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party and Indian
            National Congress proposed him for the 2012 presidential election. A month ahead of the election, Mulayam
            Singh Yadav and Mamata Banerjee also expressed their support for Kalam. Days afterwards, Mulayam Singh Yadav
            backed out, leaving Mamata Banerjee as the solitary supporter. On 18 June 2012, Kalam declined to contest
            the 2012 presidential poll. He said of his decision not to do so</p>

              me and the aspiration of the people. I am really overwhelmed by this support. This being their wish, I
              respect it. I want to thank them for the trust they have in me”
